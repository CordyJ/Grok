Grok for Turing Plus
Jim Cordy, October 2000

Revised for Turing+ 6.0, Jim Cordy, March 2019

Limitations
-----------
1. This version of Grok is written in Turing+.
    You will need to install the Open Turing+ compiler (tpc) to build it.
    https://github.com/CordyJ/TuringPlus

2. The Turing Plus translation was done ignoring warnings.  
	Many warnings will be generated when you compile this source 
    if you do not specify the tpc -w command line option.

3. Ropes (long strings) are not implemented, but are irrelevant
	in Turing+ 6.0 since strings can be up to 4095 characters.

JRC 6.2.23
